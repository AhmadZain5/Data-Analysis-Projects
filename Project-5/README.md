# (PISA 2012 Survey)
## by (Ahmad Zain)


## Dataset

> The dataset contains features that measure the knowledge, confidence, and interest of students on different subjects such as math and science and provides background information on the students from 65 different economies.

> The main data wrangling steps that were performed were to subset the main dataset based on the features of interest chosen and then save the new revised dataset. I also dropped two columns that had approximately 68% worth of missing data. Finally, I assessed numeric columns in the dataset and renamed a couple of features that could've been beneficial.


## Summary of Findings

> By classifying students' responses to various survey questions, I found that a student's level of interest in math was closely related to how a student's environment perceives the subject of math. When Introducing a third variable concerning a student's confidence in solving a certain math problem, the level of confidence for a student didn't have much effect on their interest in the subject as much as their environment. Even when they weren't very confident, they still showed an interest in the subject. The same with the level of math anxiety students reported, in environments that had strong to moderate interest in math, students were classified to have strong to moderate interest in math despite when they reported strong levels of anxiety.

> I would include my findings in the presentation, given that they're clear and not too technical.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I'll start by polishing and presenting the first set of categorical univariate barplots as they are associated with the research question and to warm up for the following explorations. To polish these plots, I would create them in columns as well as rows for better and more concise appeal rather than just being stacked in long rows. I would also associate the survey question that corresponds to each sub-plot as the label for the x-axis. I'll be removing the y-axis corresponding to the count and just keeping the encoding of bar heights as well as removing the top, right, and left part of the frame for aesthetic intentions. Finally, I'm also going to include the observations I had for this set of plots in the presentation.

> Next, I'll add the two bivariate plots and customize their frames and hide the y-axis. I'm going to add their respective observations as well.

> For multivariate exploration, I would opt for conveying the observations of the visualizations used after I set up the stage to how the multivariate plots were structured, rather than displaying them in the presentation.
